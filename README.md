# ShadCN v4 Setup

I prefer creating my own components on Nextjs projects without having to outrightly use any component library like Shadcn. However, Shadcn components are so well organized so, I usually use them as a reference for best practices when creating my components.

Now, the reason for creating this repo is that, as at the time of creating this repo, the component code easily available on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) still isn't integrated with React 19 and Next.js 15. To get the updated code, one actually has to set up shadcn in a project and install the components, and that's something I don't want to do. I then decided to set up shadcn on this repo, and install all the components so they're readily available to me. Dazzol.
